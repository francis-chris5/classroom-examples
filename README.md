# classroom-examples
This repository is a place to put example code for students in my classes (and anyone else that finds them useful) to see how to apply some standard concepts in software development.

    <p>This example finishes up a server-side scripting and tools course. The first course where I taught AJAX I tried to show too much of the power we get with it and the students just ended up overwhelmed, so the second time we just looked at throwing some basic text on a webpage to see the concepts. For odds-and-ends the last day of class we'll quickly take a look at these much better methods of getting data from MySQL to the JavaScript to dynamically control our page accordingly. These files can then be used in the future as starter scripts to copy/paste/modify according to needs.</p>
  <p>The recording of the class lecture this example went with is available at https://youtu.be/vyhCG_PX3eI</p>
